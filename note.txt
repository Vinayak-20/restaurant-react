  Redirection in react

 npm i react-router-dom

 import {BrowserRoute as router,- all routing need components
 Routes,- to set paths for each components
 Route- more than one path
 } from 'react-router-dom';







REDUX
-------


coupling= so many parent child relations/combinations(like pyrimid structure)

props drilling = in coupling if any intermediate componet have any errors, all other chinds will not work

 To avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all the component independent

  For this react introduced a new technology => state managment technology -REDUX


  REDUX process
  -------------

   create a new js file to keep the states, all the components can access the js file 

   The components only can access the data from the js file , but they can't update the data from js file




   data.js====>Component------>(dispatch request)------>Action----->(response as payload)------>Reducer







   Action= a file with all the logic to update the state
   Dispatch  = method used to dispatch the logic in action file when the component need state updation

   Reducer = update the datas in js file according to the payload response from the action file


   we need some libararies to use REDUX

   -----------------------------------------

   1) REDUX

   2) React-REDUX

   3) REDUX-THUNK 


createStore()  -method used to create store in js file
                -expect two arguments 
                      1. a Reducer
                      2. a Middileware  (used to make synchronous redux into asynchronous)

applyMiddleware()- method in redux to apply Middleware        

combineReducers()- method in REDUX used to combine all reducers in js file 

thunk - in REDUX-THUNK , used to create Middleware



1. create store 
2. apply store in idex.js 
      -provider -its a tag used topass the store 




AXIOS  -module used to make http methods
            -npm i axios


            useDispatch -hook used to dispatch actions from components -(from react redux)


to access data from store to component -useSelector -its a hook
